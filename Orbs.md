You are a Wizard attempting to rebalance the magical forces in this world. In your quest you have escaped the gluttenous
dragon of exponential backtracking and defeated the time mage with his stop-the-world curse. Finally, you have made
your way to the world energy grove.

Here, you find a collection of life (green/G) and death (red/R) orbs. You must place these orbs in order to complete
your quest. However, in order to prevent the forces of death from overwhelming the world, you cannot place more than 2
death orbs consecutively.

If you must place 50 of these life & death orbs in order within the constraints of these rules, how many possible
combinations are there? You may assume a limitless supply of each type of orb.

Summarised:

- Any number of G orbs may appear
- Any number of R orbs may appear
- Any consecutive run of R orbs must be no longer than 2
- There must be a total of N=50 orbs
- No limit on how many of each type you may use overall

Examples of valid arrangements (N=5):

- G G R G G
- R R G R R
- R G R R G

Examples of invalid arrangements (N=5):

- G G R R R
- R R R G R

**Part 2:**

In order to properly balance the world, you would like to use exactly 25 life orbs and 25 death orbs. How many possible
combinations exist with this added constraint?
